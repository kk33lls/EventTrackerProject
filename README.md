# EventTrackerProject
## About The Project
This full-stack web application functions as an exercise log, enabling users to record and manage workout details including calories burned, duration, average heart rate, date, and activity type. The application features a responsive front-end for intuitive data entry and a back-end API for secure data storage and retrieval. 

As someone who is highly active and passionate about tracking personal fitness metrics, I developed this event tracker to combine my interest in fitness with my skills in full-stack development, creating a tool that makes tracking and visualizing progress both simple and efficient.
